# /your-space/

## Introduction:

/your-space/ brings the solution to this scheduling problem in the palm of your hands. With this desktop and mobile optimized app, you can set up your profile, check what time slots are available in your co-working space, book a time slot, and easily view when you'll be working next.

### Planning for Future Enhancement
* Implement a "buddy system" so users can add other users and view whether they will be working at the same time. 
* Add more workspaces into the app so users can have a variety of options.
* Improve the overall user flow and ensure that the user experience is smooth and intuitive.
